I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the [Machine Learning Department](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), advised by Prof. [Kun Zhang](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/kunz1/) ([CMU-CLeaR Group](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/causality/)). Prior to CMU, I was a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at [Meta](https://about.facebook.com/), Ads Core ML team. I received undergraduate degrees in Computer Science and Mathematics from [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/) in 2017, where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Dan Roth](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~danroth/) and Prof. [AJ Hildebrand](https://faculty.math.illinois.edu/~hildebr/).

Research Interests
======
My current research interests are Machine Learning, Causality and Recommendation Systems. In particular, I am interested in designing principled algorithms using mathematical insights to solve real-world problems.
